Lesson 2.1
Just like in C, In Rust, the execution starts in the main function.
Functions in Rust are declared as:

==code
fn <function_name> (<argument_list>) -> <return type> {
}
==code

So we can define the main function as 

==code
fn main() {
}
==code

To print to the standard output we use the println! macro.
The ! symbol after it's name indicate that it is a macro.

To print a string using println!, we use

==code
println!("Hello World");
==code

===task
Write a hello world program in Rust that prints the following string
Hello World again!

To check your file use 
tutor check your_file.rs

===solution
Awesome. You have just written your first Rust program

	println!("Hello World again!");
}
==code
